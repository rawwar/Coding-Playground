## Variables in javascript

Here are some practice assignments on JavaScript variables, arranged from basic to more complex:

### Basic Level Assignments

1. **Variable Declaration Practice**

```javascript
// Declare variables using let, const, and var for:
// - Your name
// - Your age
// - Your favorite programming language
// - A list of your skills
// Print all of them using console.log()
```

2. **Type Conversion**

```javascript
// Declare a number variable with let
// Convert it to a string and store in another variable
// Convert it back to a number in a third variable
// Print all three and their types using typeof
```

3. **Constant vs Variable**

```javascript
// Create a const with an object containing your details
// Try to modify some properties of the object
// Try to reassign the entire object (should give error)
// Explain what happened in comments
```

### Intermediate Level Assignments

4. **Scope Understanding**

```javascript
// Create variables with the same name in different scopes
// Use var in one scope and let in another
// Try to access them from different places
// Document what works and what doesn't
```

5. **Variable Hoisting**

```javascript
// Try to use a variable before declaring it with var
// Try the same with let
// Document the different behaviors you observe
```

### Advanced Level Assignments

6. **Shopping Cart Variables**

```javascript
// Create variables for a shopping cart system:
// - Cart total (should change)
// - User ID (shouldn't change)
// - Items list (should change)
// - Discount code (shouldn't change)
// Use appropriate variable declarations (let/const)
// Add and remove items, update total
```

7. **Temperature Converter**

```javascript
// Create variables for:
// - Temperature in Celsius
// - Temperature in Fahrenheit
// - Temperature in Kelvin
// Convert between them and store results
// Use appropriate variable types
// Ensure precision is maintained
```

### Rules for Completing Assignments

1. Write comments explaining your code
2. Try to break your own code to understand limitations
3. Use console.log() to verify your results
4. Try different variable names and see what works/doesn't work
5. Test the scope of each variable type

### Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understanding when to use let, const, and var
- Grasping variable scope concepts
- Learning about variable naming conventions
- Understanding type conversion
- Practicing real-world variable usage
