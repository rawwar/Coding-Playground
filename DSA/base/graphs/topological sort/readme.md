**Graph Theory Fundamentals**:

Can be represented as an Adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.

Weight graphs : Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.

Tree: Tree is a special kind of graph that is connected and acyclic(No cycles). 
Rooted tree is a tree with directed edges.

Types of graphs:

1. Trees
2. Forests(disjoint sets of trees)
3. bipartitie graph(Vertices can be divided into two sets such that there are no edges between vertices of the same set)
4. complete graphs
5. cyclic graph
6. Acyclic graph
7. complete bipartite graph
8. Hypergraph
9.subgraph
10. Disconnected graph
