# Greedy Algorithms


- intuitive approach to solving optimization problems by making locally optimal choices at each steps.
- They don't gurantee globally optimal solutions.


### What is it?

A greedy algorithm solves problems by selecting the best immediate option at each step, aiming for a globally optimal solution.
It operates under two key principles:

1. Greedy choice property: The optimal solution can be built by choosing the best option at each step without reconsidering prior choices
2. Optimal Substructure: The overall optimal solution includes optimal solution to its subproblems.


Examples:
- Fractional Knapsack - Maximize value by prioritizing items with the highest value-to-weight ratio
- Job scheduling - Execute the shortest jobs first to minimize waiting time.
- Network Routing: Use greedy methods to forward data to the nearest node toward the destination.
